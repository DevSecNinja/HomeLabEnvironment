# #ASR113-kubernetes-cost-optimization

## Purpose

The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the Kubernetes cluster is optimized
to minimize costs while still meeting the availability, scalability, and
security requirements.

## Description

The Kubernetes cluster should be optimized to minimize costs while still meeting
the availability, scalability, and security requirements. This may include using
spot instances, turning off or scaling down resources during non-peak hours, and
implementing cost-saving features such as auto scaling or auto-provisioning.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The cluster is optimized to minimize costs
- [ ] The cluster meets availability, scalability, and security requirements
- [ ] Spot instances are used where appropriate
- [ ] Resources are turned off or scaled down during non-peak hours
- [ ] Cost-saving features such as auto scaling or auto-provisioning are implemented
- [ ] Costs are minimized without compromising availability, scalability, or security
