# ASR112-kubernetes-performance-optimization

## Purpose

The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the Kubernetes cluster is
optimized for performance.

## Description

The Kubernetes cluster should be optimized for performance, with monitoring in
place to track metrics such as CPU and memory usage, network throughput, and
disk I/O. This may include configuring the cluster to use high-performance
storage and networking options, as well as implementing horizontal pod autoscaling.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The cluster is optimized for performance
- [ ] Monitoring is in place to track metrics such as CPU and memory usage, network
throughput, and disk I/O
- [ ] High-performance storage and networking options are used
- [ ] Horizontal pod autoscaling is implemented
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds expectations
