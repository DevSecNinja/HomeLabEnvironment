# #ASR116-kubernetes-storage

## Purpose

The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the Kubernetes cluster has
the capability to use iSCSI and NFS storage protocols for data persistence.

## Description

The Kubernetes cluster must have the capability to use iSCSI and NFS storage
protocols for data persistence. This will allow for the use of different storage
solutions, and provide flexibility and availability for the data. This will also
help to scale the storage as the needs of the cluster grow.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The Kubernetes cluster has the capability to use iSCSI and NFS storage
protocols for data persistence
- [ ] Data stored using iSCSI and NFS storage protocols is available and accessible
- [ ] The Kubernetes cluster can scale storage as needed
- [ ] The data is stored in a way that supports high-availability and disaster recovery
- [ ] The cluster supports different storage solutions.
