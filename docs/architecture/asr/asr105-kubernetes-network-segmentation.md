# #ASR105-kubernetes-network-segmentation

## Purpose

The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the Kubernetes cluster has network
segmentation for isolation of different namespaces or environments.

## Description

The Kubernetes cluster must have network segmentation capabilities to isolate different
namespaces or environments. This will ensure that different environments, such as
production and development, are isolated from each other and cannot accidentally
interact.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The cluster has network segmentation capabilities for isolation of different
namespaces or environments
- [ ] Traffic between different namespaces or environments is properly isolated
- [ ] There are no unintended interactions between different namespaces or environments
