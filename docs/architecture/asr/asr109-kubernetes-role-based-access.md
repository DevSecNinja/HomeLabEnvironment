services have access to the cluster and its components, and that access is
restricted based on roles and permissions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The cluster is configured with role-based access controls (RBAC)
- [ ] Only authorized users and services have access to the cluster and its components
- [ ] Access is restricted based on roles and permissions
