# ASR115-kubernetes-network-segmentation

## Purpose

The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the Kubernetes cluster
has network segmentation capabilities to isolate different namespaces or
environments, and to protect the network from unauthorized access or malicious activity.

## Description

The Kubernetes cluster must have network segmentation capabilities to isolate
different namespaces or environments. This will ensure that different environments,
such as production and development, are isolated from each other and cannot accidentally
interact. The cluster should also have firewalls and other security mechanisms in
place to protect the network from unauthorized access or malicious activity.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The cluster has network segmentation capabilities for isolation of different
namespaces or environments
- [ ] Traffic between different namespaces or environments is properly isolated
- [ ] There are no unintended interactions between different namespaces or environments
- [ ] The cluster has firewalls and other security mechanisms in place to protect
the network from unauthorized access or malicious activity
- [ ] The network is protected from unauthorized access or malicious activity
