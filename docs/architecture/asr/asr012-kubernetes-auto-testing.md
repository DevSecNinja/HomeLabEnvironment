# #ASR012-kubernetes-auto-testing

## Purpose

The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the applications deployed on the
Kubernetes cluster are thoroughly tested before they are released to production.

## Description

The Kubernetes cluster should be configured to run automated tests on deployed
applications, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. This
will ensure that applications are functioning as expected and that any issues are
identified and addressed before they reach production.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automated tests are run on all deployed applications
- [ ] Tests include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
- [ ] Tests are run before the application is deployed to production
- [ ] Tests are run on a regular basis
- [ ] Applications are thoroughly tested before they are released to production
